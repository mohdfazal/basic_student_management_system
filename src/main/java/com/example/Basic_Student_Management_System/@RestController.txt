The @RestController annotation in Spring is a specialized version of the @Controller
annotation. It is typically used in Spring MVC applications where you want to build
RESTful web services. By default, it combines the behavior of @Controller and @ResponseBody
annotations, making it easier to create web services that return JSON or XML responses directly.

Explanation:
1. @Controller vs. @RestController

@Controller is used for handling traditional MVC web applications where the controller returns
a view (e.g., JSP, HTML page) in response to a client request.

@RestController is used to handle REST API requests, returning data (typically JSON or XML)
instead of a view.

2. Automatic @ResponseBody Behavior

When you use @RestController, Spring automatically assumes that every method in the controller
will return the response body directly. This means you don't have to annotate each method with
@ResponseBody to indicate that the returned object should be serialized into JSON or XML.
In a traditional controller, if you want to return JSON, you would use @ResponseBody like this:

java
Copy code
@Controller
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/getData")
    @ResponseBody
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
With @RestController, this becomes:
java
Copy code
@RestController
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/getData")
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}

3. Typical Use Case

You would use @RestController when building a REST API, where you want your methods to return
JSON or XML data for consumption by front-end applications, mobile apps, or other services.

Example:

java
Copy code
@RestController
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/getStudent")
    public Student getStudent() {
        return new Student(1, "John Doe", "Computer Science");
    }
}
In this example, the getStudent method returns a Student object, and Spring will automatically convert this Java object to a JSON or XML representation (depending on the client request's Accept header).
4. How It Works Internally
The @RestController annotation tells Spring that the controller will handle HTTP requests and return data directly (not a view).
The returned objects are serialized into the requested format (usually JSON) using HttpMessageConverters (such as MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter for JSON).
5. Example: REST API with @RestController
java
Copy code
@RestController
public class ProductController {

    @PostMapping("/addProduct")
    public String addProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        // Code to add product to the database
        return "Product added successfully!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/getProduct/{id}")
    public Product getProduct(@PathVariable int id) {
        // Code to retrieve product by id
        return new Product(id, "Laptop", 1200.00);
    }
}
@PostMapping: Handles HTTP POST requests to add a product.
@GetMapping: Handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve a product by ID.
@RequestBody: Maps the request body (JSON or XML) to the Product object.
@PathVariable: Extracts the variable from the URL to use in the method (e.g., /getProduct/1).
When to Use @RestController
When you're building RESTful APIs that will return JSON or XML responses.
When you donâ€™t need to return views (like JSP or Thymeleaf) but only data to the client.
In summary, @RestController simplifies building RESTful services by combining the behavior of @Controller and @ResponseBody, enabling you to create endpoints that return data instead of views.
